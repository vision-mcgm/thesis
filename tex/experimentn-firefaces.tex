\section{Experiment n: Loading the perceptual system with faces and fire}

\subsection{Methodology}

\paragraph{Stimuli}

A 10,000-frame corpus of consecutive fire images was used.



\paragraph{Subjects}

8 subjects were recruited using a mailing list operated by University College London. All reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

\paragraph{Trial structure}

Yes-no dual delayed match-to-sample.
In each trial, we presented two tests (one fire clip and one face clip), followed by two samples(one fire clip and one face clip). After each test, subjects indicated whether they thought it matched the corresponding test (up arrow) or not (down arrow).

We thus derived two accuracy measures: fire accuracy and face accuracy.

Sample lengths were all 100 frames (2 s) and test lengths were all 120 frames (2.4 s).

\paragraph{Factors}

We varied the order in which samples were shown (fire first or face first).
We always showed the fire test before the face test.

\paragraph{Block structure}

No training trials were used.
