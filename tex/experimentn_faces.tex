\chapter{Temporal search for faces}

\section{Face stimuli}

We also used several different portrait video clips of facial motion, recorded at 50fps. We show the frame counts here:

50fps

x3\_Free	2538
xs\_HCB		830
x3\_TGDoY	1064
x3\_TTLs	1332
x4\_Free	2208
x4\_HCB		814
x4\_TGODoY	1002
x4\_TTLS	1158
x5\_Free	1830
x5\_HCB		798
x5\_TGODoY	859
x5\_TTLS	1318
x8\_Free	2937
x8\_HCB		737
x8\_TGODoY	958
x8\_TTLS	1306

These clips consisted of either free facial motion (the subject was instructed to speak freely) or video of the subject singing along with nursery rhymes.
